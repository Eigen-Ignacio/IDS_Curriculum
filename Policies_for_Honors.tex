		\textbf{Academic Excellence Awards} \\
		The Academic Excellence Award is given to students who earned the highest academic grade in a particular subject.

		\textbf{Service Awards} \\
		The Service Award is given to students from any grade level who have rendered exemplary service to the school for the current school year. This particular service must be outside of the expectations of any office held. This award is given upon the recommendation of any faculty member, and need not be awarded every year.

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
			\item The following honors are given during the completion ceremonies
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{}}
					\textbf{With Highest Honors} \\
					\textbf{High High Honors}\\
					\textbf{With Honors}\\
					\textbf{With Distinction}
				\end{tabular}
			\end{center}
			
			The aforementioned awards will be given to any member of the graduating class who
			\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
				\item[a.] does not have any failing grade in any subject in any grading period
				(Grade 7-10) 
				\item[b.] does not have any grade below 80 in their 9th and 10th grades. 
				\item[c.] has completed the last two years of junior high school in IDS 
				\item[d.] has completed the junior high school academic program for four
				consecutive years. 
				\item[e.] has not committed any of the category C offenses for the school year.
				\item[f.] will be ranked according to their overall weighted average (OWA). \\
				
				The OWA will be computed using the formula shown below:
				
				\begin{equation}
					OWA = \frac{\text{\textit{WA Grade 9}} + \text{\textit{WA of 3 grading periods in Grade 10}}}{2}
				\end{equation}
			\end{enumerate}
			
			Where: 
			\begin{align*}
				OWA &= \text{\textit{Overall Weighted Average}} \\
				WA &= \text{\textit{Weighted Average}}
			\end{align*}
			
			\item The following criteria and the corresponding relative weights shall be used in determining the With Highest Honors, With High Honors, With Honors and With Distinction awards.

			\textbf{
			\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
					\item[a.] \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{\hspace{11.5em}}l@{}}
						Academic Excellence & $70\%$ \\
					\end{tabular}
					\item[b.] \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{\hspace{2em}}l@{}}
						Co-Curricular/Extra Curricular Excellence & $30\%$ \\
					\end{tabular}
			\end{enumerate}}
			
			The computed values for the OWA are considered as the candidatesâ€™Academic Excellence points while the Co-Curricular and Extra Curricular Excellence points are based on their involvement in non-academic pursuits. Hence, completion candidates are expected to submit supporting documents for their community involvement and active participation in authorized student organizations or clubs, literary-musical and athletic activities in the class, year levels, school as well as participation in citywide, regional, inter-regional, national and international contests as approved by the school.
